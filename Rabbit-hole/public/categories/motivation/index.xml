      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;struggling-with-motivation-a-personal-journey&#34;&gt;Struggling with Motivation: A Personal Journey&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The struggle for motivation is perhaps universal, but for me, it rings particularly true. Whether in my personal interests, such as gaming and watching movies, or in my professional pursuits, such as software development, maintaining focus has always been a challenge. This difficulty, I suspect, might be a consequence of untreated childhood ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 30 years old, I find my ability to persevere through tasks dwindling. Even things I deeply enjoy seem to lose my interest rapidly. As time goes on, this challenge appears to grow stronger. As I&amp;rsquo;m typing this, a part of me is already contemplating abandoning the task, forgetting that it was ever started. Ironic in a post that&amp;rsquo;s about lack of motivation, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
