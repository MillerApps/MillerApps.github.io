      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;struggling-with-motivation-a-personal-journey&#34;&gt;Struggling with Motivation: A Personal Journey&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The struggle for motivation is perhaps universal, but for me, it rings particularly true. Whether in my personal interests, such as gaming and watching movies, or in my professional pursuits, such as software development, maintaining focus has always been a challenge. This difficulty, I suspect, might be a consequence of untreated childhood ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 30 years old, I find my ability to persevere through tasks dwindling. Even things I deeply enjoy seem to lose my interest rapidly. As time goes on, this challenge appears to grow stronger. As I&amp;rsquo;m typing this, a part of me is already contemplating abandoning the task, forgetting that it was ever started. Ironic in a post that&amp;rsquo;s about lack of motivation, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So what is a KeyPath in Swift? Lets try to answer this in a simply way, note this will not be in depth, but rather a very basic rundown of what a KeyPath is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ðŸ“˜ Info&#xA;Please Note: I Am not an expert and this is more or less a way for me to help cement the basics of this concept in my own mind. If this is of any Value to you, thats just an added bonus!&#xA;{: .blockquote-info }&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years have passed since I last engaged with this site and shared content. This platform remains a personal space where I post items that pique my interest or prove useful to me. During my hiatus, I ventured into construction, building and working with concrete. Before that, I had a stint in the oil fields, and even earlier in 2018, I contributed to an open-source project called Trust Wallet, which Binance eventually acquired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
