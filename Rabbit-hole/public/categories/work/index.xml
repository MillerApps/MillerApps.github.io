      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years have passed since I last engaged with this site and shared content. This platform remains a personal space where I post items that pique my interest or prove useful to me. During my hiatus, I ventured into construction, building and working with concrete. Before that, I had a stint in the oil fields, and even earlier in 2018, I contributed to an open-source project called Trust Wallet, which Binance eventually acquired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
