title: Secure DNS Setup with pfSense, AdGuard Home, and Tailscale
url: dns-fun

## Current Setup Overview

> **Disclaimer:**  
> I am not an expert nor do I claim to be!  
> I am simply a man who decided to learn more about networking and went down the rabbit hole of DNS and DNS encryption.
> 
> *This is my personal experience; use it as a starting point for your own explorations.*

My current setup involves the following components and configurations to ensure secure and private DNS resolution:

1. **Client Device to pfSense:**  
   - DNS requests from client devices are sent to pfSense in plain text (for unencrypted, unsupported devices). On devices capable of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT), full encryption is applied from the client onward. Otherwise, DNS requests remain unencrypted at the client level.

2. **pfSense to AdGuard Home:**  
   - pfSense forwards DNS requests to AdGuard Home using SSL/TLS with the designated certificates (to be created later).

3. **AdGuard Home:**  
   - Processes DNS requests, applying filtering rules.
   - Forwards DNS requests to Mullvad’s DNS servers using either DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT).

4. **Tailscale:**  
   - Routes DNS traffic through pfSense for mobile devices when off the home network.
   - This ensures that DNS queries are encrypted between mobile devices and pfSense, though not necessarily end-to-end.

```

### Summary of Security Benefits

-  **Encryption from pfSense to AdGuard Home:** DNS queries are encrypted with SSL/TLS.
-  **Encryption from AdGuard Home to Mullvad’s DNS Servers:** DNS queries are encrypted using DoH or DoT.
-  **Privacy:** Minimizes logging risks from third-party DNS providers and cell carriers.
-  **Ad and Tracker Blocking:** AdGuard Home blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level.
-  **Consistency:** The same DNS filtering rules apply both at home and on the go (via a reverse proxy or Tailscale).

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install and Configure AdGuard Home

1. **Download and Install AdGuard Home:**  

   - Automated Install (Linux/Unix/MacOS/FreeBSD/OpenBSD):
     [AdGuard Home Automated Install](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#automated-install-linuxunixmacosfreebsdopenbsd)
     
     ```sh
     curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
     ```

   - Proxmox Helper Script:
     [Proxmox Helper Script](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/#adguard-home-lxc)
     
     ```sh
     bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/ct/adguard.sh)"
     ```

2. **Access the Web Interface:**  
   In your web browser, navigate to:  
   `http://<your_server_ip>:3000`  
   and complete the setup.

### Step 2: Configure AdGuard Home

1. **Access the AdGuard Home Web Interface:**  
   Navigate to `http://<your_server_ip>:3000`.

2. **Set Up Upstream DNS Servers:**  

   - Go to **Settings** → **DNS Settings**.
   - Under **Upstream DNS servers**, add:
     - `https://dns.mullvad.net/dns-query` (for DoH)
     - `tls://dns.mullvad.net` (for DoT)

3. **Configure Encryption:**  
   More details can be found in the [AdGuard Home Encryption Wiki](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Encryption).

   - Go to **Settings** → **Encryption Settings**.
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates.
   - Set up Let's Encrypt certs using Certbot:

     ```sh
     sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --preferred-chain="ISRG Root X1"
     ```

     Follow the instructions provided by Certbot. Provide your domain (and wildcard if needed) during the process.  
     After completion, you'll receive two files:
       - `fullchain.pem` – PEM-encoded SSL certificate.
       - `privkey.pem` – PEM-encoded private key.
     
     Either paste the contents into the fields or provide the full file paths, then save and apply.

### Step 3: Configure pfSense for Secure DNS Forwarding

1. **Install the Certificate:**  

   - In pfSense, navigate to **System** → **Cert Manager**.
   - Import your SSL/TLS certificate and private key (simply use `cat <path>` to copy the full output contents).

2. **Set Up AdGuard as the DNS Server:**  

   - Go to **System** → **General Setup**.
   - Under DNS Settings, add the IPv4 and (if applicable) IPv6 addresses for AdGuard.
   - Save and apply.

3. **Configure the DNS Resolver (Unbound):**  

   - Navigate to **Services** → **DNS Resolver**.
   - Enable the DNS Resolver.
   - Leave ports as default.
   - Enable SSL/TLS Service.
   - Select the certificate installed previously.
   - Choose the interfaces to use (e.g., All if unsure).
   - Under **DNS Query Forwarding**:
     - Enable Forwarding Mode.
     - Use SSL/TLS for outgoing DNS queries to forwarding servers (this forwards DNS queries to AdGuard via DoT).
   - Save and apply.

### Step 4: Configure Tailscale

Enable SSH Access:
  
1. In pfSense, navigate to **System** → **Advanced** → **Admin Access**.
2. Under **Secure Shell**, check "Enable Secure Shell".
3. (Optional) Change the default port from **22**.
4. From your terminal, connect using:
   ```sh
   ssh -p <port-if-changed> <your-admin-name>@<your-pfsense-ip>
   ```
5. Select option `8` (Shell) from the pfSense menu.
6. Run the following to install Tailscale:
   ```sh
   pkg add -f https://pkg.freebsd.org/FreeBSD:14:amd64/latest/All/tailscale-1.70.0.pkg
   ```
   (Replace the URL with the latest version if updated; `1.70.0` was released on **07/17/24**.)

7. (Optional) Add firewall rules to restrict SSH access from WAN for increased security.
</details>

1. **Install Tailscale on pfSense:**  

   - Follow the official Tailscale documentation to install it via pfSense’s package manager.  
   - Go to **System** → **Package Manager** → **Available Packages**.  
   - Note: At times the available version might lag behind; check [this forum discussion](https://forum.netgate.com/topic/174525/how-to-update-to-the-latest-tailscale-version/60) for updates.

2. **Configure Tailscale to Use pfSense as DNS:**  

   - Navigate to **VPN** → **Tailscale** → **Settings**.
   - Under DNS, uncheck "Accept DNS" (if checked) to prevent Tailscale from overriding your DNS settings.
   - Under Routing, uncheck "Accept Subnet Routes" if it’s enabled.
     - Add the IP of pfSense (for example, `192.168.1.1/32`) to Advertised Routes.
     - Optionally, add AdGuard's IP if you wish to access its admin panel remotely.
   - Save and apply the changes.

3. **Approve Routes and Configure DNS in Tailscale Admin:**  

   - Visit [Tailscale’s Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines), select your pfSense machine.
   - Under the “Subnets” section, approve the awaiting routes.
   - In the “DNS” tab, enable "override local DNS".
   - Add a custom nameserver pointing to your advertised pfSense IP.
   - Optionally, disable key expiry by selecting the three vertical dots (ellipsis) next to your pfSense machine and opting for "Disable key expiry". More details can be found [here](https://tailscale.com/kb/1028/key-expiry?q=key).

4. **Install Tailscale on Mobile Devices:**  

   - Download and install the Tailscale app on your mobile devices.
   - Log in with your Tailscale account and enable the Tailscale DNS settings.

### Optional Step 5: Configure Clients

#### Configure macOS & iOS for DoH/DoT

1. **Using Built-in Support (macOS 11+ and iOS 14+):**

   - Refer to the following resources:
     - [paulmillr/encrypted-dns on GitHub](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns)
     - [Mullvad's Profiles for Encrypted DNS](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/profiles-to-configure-our-encrypted-dns-on-apple-devices)
     - [Quad9 iOS Mobile Provisioning Profiles](https://www.quad9.net/news/blog/ios-mobile-provisioning-profiles)

2. **Using AdGuard Profiles:**  
   - Under **Setup Guide** → **DNS Privacy**, configure a profile using a hostname (e.g., `adguard.<your-domain>`).  
   - Refer to the [AdGuard Teams documentation on ClientIDs](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Clients#clientid).

3. **Alternative: pfSense Profile Configuration:**  
   - Create a configuration profile pointing to pfSense instead of AdGuard using [Apple's DNS profile docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings) or an [online tool](https://dns.notjakob.com/index.html).  
   - Note: This setup works only on your home network unless paired with Tailscale. Do not reverse proxy pfSense.

4. **Caveats with Profiles:**  
   - Profiles without a reverse proxy will only work on your Home Network. With Tailscale, encrypted DNS is still maintained via the VPN tunnel to pfSense.
   - If using an AdGuard profile, the VPN bypasses pfSense, but round-trip encryption remains intact.
   - For a signed profile, use your Apple developer account; more info is available [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/create-and-edit-configuration-profiles-pmd85719196/mac).

#### Android

-  Android 9+ supports DNS-over-TLS natively. To configure, go to:  
  **Settings** → **Network & internet** → **Advanced** → **Private DNS** and enter your domain name.

#### Windows

-  Windows 10 Build 19628 and later support DNS-over-HTTPS natively.

## Conclusion

This setup ensures that DNS requests remain encrypted and private between pfSense and AdGuard Home, and from AdGuard Home to Mullvad’s DNS servers. Although client-to-pfSense queries may not always be encrypted, using Tailscale secures connections for mobile devices when away from home. By leveraging pfSense, AdGuard Home, and Tailscale, you've built a robust and secure DNS resolution process.

Is this the ultimate solution? Probably not—it's the framework I built while learning about networking. I hope you enjoy this journey down the rabbit hole with me. Until next time, happy exploring!
