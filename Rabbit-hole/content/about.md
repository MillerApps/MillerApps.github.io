Hi, I'm Tyler Miller from Michigan, USA. I began my dev journey in 2012. I enjoyed developing iOS apps using Swift and Objective-C, and over time, I kinda called programming quits (roughly 7 years). I've decided to look into the world of Go. Recently, I've also developed an interest in Nix—a tool that helps me streamline my Mac setup and refine my development environment. I'm also a big fan of the Catppuccin color palette, which you'll likely notice throughout this site!

On this platform, I'll be sharing the projects and topics that excite me. Whether it's diving into new programming languages or experimenting with cutting-edge tools, I hope my experiences inspire fellow developers and enthusiasts.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/millerapps) for a closer look at what I'm working on.

Thanks for stopping by—I look forward to hearing from you!
