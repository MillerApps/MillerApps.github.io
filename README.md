I am using the Hugo static website generator, for two reasons:
1. I'm Lazy and don't really want to make a website from scratch
2. Jekyll is not really updated anymore

> [!NOTE] 
> This repo makes use of Nix to set up a dev shell with all the needed tolls for Hugo, which includes Hugo as well.
> Nix is rather cool and useful.

To use the Nix dev shell environment run:
```sh
nix develop
```
Here are a few aspects of Hugo that really resonate with my lazy, get-things-done approach:
- Lightning-Fast Builds
- Easy to Learn
- Built-In Server & Live Reloading
- Powered by Golang
- No need to really worry about much aside from Markdown
